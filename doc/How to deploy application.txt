This instruction explains how to deploy the project from project archive (not binary)
=====================================================================================

Prerequisites

To run the Student Scheduling System, you need:
1. JDK 6 or later (for JDK 7 see installation instructions here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html ).
2. MySQL sever v5 or later (see installation instructions here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ )
3. play framework v2 or later (see installation instructions here: http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0.4/Installing or you can find the same instruction in Installing Play.txt)


Deploying on the Lunux/Unix server

1. unzip the project archive in the desired directory (current directory by default):
unzip ./student_scheduling_system_v1.x.zip

2. deploy DB:
2.1 set URL, user name and password of MySQL server in the  student_scheduling_system/application.conf:

db.default.url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/student_scheduling_system"
db.default.user = root
db.default.pass = ""

2.2 erase existing instance of DB (optional):
./student_scheduling_system/db/db_drop_schema.sh 

2.3 initialize DB schema:
./student_scheduling_system/db/db_schema.sh 

2.4 initial DB filling:
./student_scheduling_system/db/db_init_values.sh

3. change directory to the project folder:
cd ./student_scheduling_system

4. run play (make sure you have updated your PATH environment variable, so that play directory is there):
play

5. now in play console type:
start 8080
where 8080 - is a port number. You can use any available port number.

After that application should be available here: http://yourhostname:8080/
where 'yourhostname' is your server's name or IP address.


Deploying on the Windows server

1. unzip the project archive student_scheduling_system_v1.x.zip in the desired directory.

2. deploy DB:
2.1 set URL, user name and password of MySQL server in the  student_scheduling_system/application.conf:

db.default.url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/student_scheduling_system"
db.default.user = root
db.default.pass = ""

2.2 erase existing instance of DB (optional):
student_scheduling_system/db/db_drop_schema.bat

2.3 initialize DB schema:
student_scheduling_system/db/db_schema.bat

2.4 initial DB filling:
student_scheduling_system/db/db_init_values.bat

3. change directory to the project folder:
cd student_scheduling_system

4. run play (make sure you have updated your PATH environment variable, so that play directory is there):
play

5. now in play console type:
start 8080
where 8080 - is a port number. You can use any available port number.

After that application should be available here: http://yourhostname:8080/
where 'yourhostname' is your server's name or IP address.
