<p>The purpose of Student Scheduling System is to provide a study plan creation facilitator for both undergrad students and faculty of Steven’s Institute of Technology. </p>

<p>With current manual method, forming a single study plan for a single student may take hours of collaborative work of advisors and students and regarding each student has different course history or plans, they need to form unique study plan for the majority of the students. </p>

<p>By using the Student Scheduling System; this process is automated; in other words, after entering the data representing his/her course history/graduation plans, a student can get possible study plan generated by the system. And for the administrative side; they can add/remove courses to the system, modify courses’ features/information, form new course groups and create new degree programs. Meanwhile they are also able to delete/modify these course groups, degree programs or even requirements to complete these programs. </p>
